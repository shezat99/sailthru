--Alternatively, the totals can be shown on Tableau dashboard as well if that is being used for vidualization . 

-- total_historical_emails_sent and total_historical_mails_opened
-- Cannot define the historical mail from the information provided, so this part is skipped.

-- How to avoid duplicate data in the system
-- Based on the information provided, restriciting the send_time to the minimum i.e. min(send_time) might solve the issue. 
-- this restriction can be done in Tableau as well if that is being used for vidualization 

--To make sure that the user is looking at the most updated data.
-- one solution might be to create a new table and enter the current time stamp in that after loading the data in redshift
--   and display the content of this table somewhere on the dashboard.
